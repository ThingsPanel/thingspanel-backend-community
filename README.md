# ThingsPanel
ThingsPanel is a **lightweight, componentized** open-source IoT application support platform, designed to reduce development efforts and accelerate IoT project construction through reusable plugins.

## Key Plugins
- **Device Function Templates**: Integrates physical models with charts.
- **Device Configuration Templates**: Combines device function templates with protocol plugins.
- **Protocol Access Plugins**: Addresses various protocol access issues.
- **Service Access Plugins**: Allows device access through third-party platforms.
- **Dashboard Cards**: Extends dashboard display capabilities.
- **Visualization Plugins**: Expands functionality for large-screen visualization.
- **Dependency Plugins**: Building blocks for industry solutions.

Using these plugins **repeatedly** can greatly improve R&D efficiency.
